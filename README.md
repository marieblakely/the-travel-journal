### Description:

##### Welcome back to the 90's. 90's Trivia Quiz Game is a game that takes you back to some of your favorite tv shows, movies, toys, and music. The category cards can be clicked, which will then display questions related to that category. You can test your knowledge of the 90's by answering as many questions as you can  correctly before the time runs out. I chose this game to take everyone on a journey back to the 90's where some of the best music, tv shows, toys, and movies brought us some of the best memories.
